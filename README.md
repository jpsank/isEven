# isEven
My version of an isEven function using Goldbach's conjecture and the laws of arithmetic on even and odd integers

## About
Checks for even using [Goldbach's conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture), which states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

Also uses the laws of addition and subtraction on even and odd numbers:
 - even ± even = even
 - even ± odd = odd
 - odd ± odd = even

Disclaimer: numbers in the thousands may start to take a while
